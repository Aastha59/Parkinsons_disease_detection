# Parkinson's Disease Detection using SVM

This project implements a machine learning model to detect Parkinson's disease using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. It uses the `parkinsons.csv` dataset, which contains biomedical voice measurements from patients with and without Parkinson's disease.

## Overview
The project:
- Preprocesses and standardizes the data for model training.
- Implements an SVM model with a linear kernel to classify whether a person has Parkinson's disease.
- Evaluates the model's performance on training and testing datasets.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used is `parkinsons.csv`, which includes:
- **Attributes**: Biomedical voice measurements.
- **Target Column**: `status` (1 indicates Parkinson's disease, 0 indicates no disease).
- **Size**: 24 features and multiple samples.

---

## Dependencies
The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

---

## Workflow
1. **Load Dataset**: Read the `parkinsons.csv` file.
2. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
3. **Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values (none in this dataset).
   - Separate features (`X`) and target (`Y`).
   - Standardize the features using `StandardScaler`.
4. **Train-Test Split**: Split the data into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Training**: Train an SVM classifier with a linear kernel.
6. **Evaluation**:
   - Measure accuracy on training and testing data.
   - Predict the status for new input data.
7. **Prediction**:
   - Input custom data for prediction.
   - Output whether Parkinson's disease is detected.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/parkinsons-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd parkinsons-detection
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python parkinsons_detection.py
   ```
4. For custom input data, modify the `input_data` tuple in the script.

---

## Results
- **Training Data Accuracy**: High accuracy observed during training.
- **Testing Data Accuracy**: Model performs well on unseen data.
- **Custom Input Prediction**:
  - Prints "Negative, No Parkinson's found" if `status=0`.
  - Prints "Positive, Parkinson's found" if `status=1`.
